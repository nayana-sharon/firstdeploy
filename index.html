<h1>System development life cycle</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step.
</p>
<h2>phases of SDLC</h2>

<h2>
planning
</h2>
<p>
The first phase of the SDLC is the project planning stage where you are gathering business requirements from your client or stakeholders. This phase is when you evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, the cost of production, the needs of the end-users, etc
</p>
<h2>analysis</h2>
<p>Requirements gathering is a crucial phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) and project management. It involves collecting, documenting, and managing the requirements that define the features and functionalities of a system or applicati</p>
<h2>design</h2>
<p>
In SDLC, the design phase is a stage where software developers define the technical details of the product. Depending on the project, these details can include screen designs, databases, sketches, system interfaces, and prototypes. Clients use these details to make final product design choice</p>
<h2>implementation</h2>
<p>Implementation includes user notification, user training, installation of hardware, installation of software onto production computers, and integration of the system into daily work processes.</p>
<h2>testing</h2>
<p>In this fifth phase of SDLC, the testing is done to ensure that the entire application works according to the customer requirements. After testing, the QA and testing team might find some bugs or defects and communicate the same with the developers</p>
<h2>deployment</h2>
<p>
The deployment phase is the final step in the software development life cycle and delivers the final product to the customer in a live production environment. After the product deploys, the product is ready for customers to use</p>
